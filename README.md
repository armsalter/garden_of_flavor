🌟 About the Project
Garden of Flavor is more than just a website – it’s a digital café experience. Designed and developed from scratch, this project showcases my front-end development skills and creativity through a fully functional restaurant prototype. With a handcrafted mock database, all interactions feel real while remaining lightweight and backend-free.

Whether you're exploring the elegant menu, navigating the cozy layout, or placing a test order, this project is built to impress – both visually and technically.

Feel free to fork, explore, and taste the Garden of Flavor.
Bon appétit – and happy coding! 🍽️🌸
